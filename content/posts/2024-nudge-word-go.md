My 2024 nudge word is *go.* Go do the thing. Go to the place. Go see the friends you haven't seen in a while. Go attend the conference or networking event you were too shy or scared to go to before. Go to new places, go see new sights, go do new things. Go challenge yourself. Go. 

Since the pandemic started I've found it really hard to get out and do things, both due to fear of the virus and because of increasing social anxiety after long periods of relative isolation. I'm happy to say that I made big strides towards getting over those fears in 2023 and I'd like to continue working toward that in 2024. So, *go*. I will go!
